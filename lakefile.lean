/-! # `LPBackendPure` build configuration

  Pure-Lean LP backend: zero native deps, zero subprocess calls.
  Self-registers with the `lp-tactic` registry under priority 100
  ("pure tier") on import.

  This is the zero-deps backend for CI and demos. Performance is
  expected to be poor — the verifier needs exact rationals
  (`Rat`), not Floats, so the simplex runs on arbitrary-precision
  arithmetic the whole way through. The point is to let users get
  `by lp` working with a single `import` and zero install steps.
